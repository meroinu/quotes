# Quotes
### Build
`yarn build` or `npm run build`

### Start
`yarn start` or `npm run start`

### Tools
* nextjs for the quick start
* style jsx for the simple styling of the small project (would use styled-components maybe, but it's overkill now)
* typescript to ease my pain a little

### Notes
* 1s update because FMFW allows only 1s (or maybe I overlooked smth)
* get tickers snapshot and symbols (2 endpoints instead of 1): snapshot to display tickers data immediately, and symbols to make ticker column look pretty; also I guess in the future symbols data maybe useful
* use socket ticker/batch to get updates in batches (seems more convinient for me)
* have a good day, don't forget to drink water and eat some fruits
